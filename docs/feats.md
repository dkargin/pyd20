# Local feat description #


Defencive Sweep. Pre: BAB+15. AoO if adjacent enemy does not move. PHBII pg 78.



## Combat Expertise ##
You are trained at using your combat skill for defense as well as offense.

**Prerequisite**: INT 13

### Benefit ###
When you use the attack action or the full attack action in melee, you can take a penalty of as much as -5 on your attack roll and add the same number (+5 or less) as a dodge bonus to your Armor Class. This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The changes to attack rolls and Armor Class last until your next action.

**Special** : A fighter may select Combat Expertise as one of his fighter bonus feats (see page 38).
Normal

A character without the Combat Expertise feat can fight defensively while using the attack or full attack action to take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class.


## Quick Staff [Style] ( Complete Warrior, p. 114) ##
You have mastered the style of fighting with a quarterstaff, and have learned special maneuvers that complement this unique weapon.

**Prerequisite**: Combat Expertise (PH) , Dodge (PH) , Two-Weapon Fighting (PH) , Weapon Focus (PH) (quarterstaff)

### Benefit: ###
When you use Combat Expertise to gain a dodge bonus while wielding a quarterstaff, you gain a dodge bonus 2 points higher than the penalty you take on your attack rolls. For example, if you take a -1 penalty on your attack rolls, you gain a +3 dodge bonus to your AC.


## Elusive target [Tactical] ##

Trying to land a blow against you can be a maddening experience.

**Prerequisite**: Dodge (PH) , Mobility (PH) , base attack bonus +6

### Benefit ###

The Elusive Target feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers.

**Negate Power Attack** : To use this maneuver, you must designate a specific foe to be affected by your Dodge feat. If that foe uses the Power Attack feat against you, the foe gains no bonus on the damage roll but still takes the corresponding penalty on the attack roll.

**Diverting Defense** : To use this maneuver, you must be flanked and you must designate one of the flanking attackers to be affected by your Dodge feat. The first attack of the round from the designated attacker automatically misses you and may strike the other flanking foe instead; the attacking creature makes an attack roll normally, and its ally is considered flatfooted. If the designated attacker is making a full attack against you, its second and subsequent attacks function normally.

**Cause Overreach** : To use this maneuver, you must provoke an attack of opportunity from a foe by moving out of a threatened square. If the foe misses you, you can make a free trip attempt against this foe, and the foe does not get a chance to trip you if your attempt fails.


### High Sword Low Axe [Style] ###

You have mastered the style of fighting with sword and axe at the same time, and have learned to use this unusual pairing of weapons to pull your opponents off their feet.

**Prerequisite**: Improved Trip (PH) , Two-Weapon Fighting (PH) , Weapon Focus (PH) (bastard sword, longsword, scimitar or shortsword) , Weapon Focus (PH) (battleaxe, handaxe, or dwarven waraxe) ,

### Benefit ###

If you hit the same creature with both your sword and your axe in the same round, you may make a free trip attempt against that foe. (If you succeed, you may immediately use your Improved Trip feat to gain an additional attack against your foe.)
